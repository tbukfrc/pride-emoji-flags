# pride-emoji-flags
A simple repository by [JoyPixels](https://www.joypixels.com) to provide a fully-inclusive set of pride emoji flags.

## what's included?
All the original JoyPixels flags, and the new ones added by me, in PNG format only (sorry). The PSD file with all the flags contianed is also in the repo. The new flags were created using the original emojis as a template.

## what are the added flags?
Added flags are:
- Toric
- Trixic
- Demiromantic
- Demiboy
- Demigirl
- Demigender
- Aroflux
- Aceflux
- Aroace
- Abrosexual
- Bigender
- Pangender
- Genderflux
- Gay Men
- Progress
- Omnisexual

If anyone has any requests, I will create them add them to the repo.

## how can I use them?
These flags have not been recommended for general use (RGI) by Unicode, meaning there is
no globally shared emoji code point by which they can be referred. A [petition](https://www.change.org/p/pride-flag-emojis?recruiter=971295933&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink)
exists to help drive the movement for inclusion into Unicode.

These flags are released under the Creative Commons [(CC-BY-4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) 
license so that there are few limits
on the ways they can be used. Websites, apps, sticker packs, and physical goods (stickers, posters, etc)

## thank you!
And thanks to [Fullscreen Inc](https://fullscreen.com/) for the inspiration and guidance. Also, thanks to JoyPixels for creating the original emoji set.
